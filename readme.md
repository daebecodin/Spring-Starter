# Spring Boot Starter

- This project will consist of usage examples of the core concepts of Spring.
- This is me just setting up and configuring up a spring project from scratch.
- More so using this as a template in case I get lost when doing a real project.
- I have this starter as a fal back to look.
- This is also good for reinforcement on how a spring project should function and look like.
## 1. Creating your Spring project
- you can use [Spring Boot Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) or use your IDE if choice with Springs integrations.
## 2. Adding dependencies (You can skip)
- Dependencies can be found [here](https://mvnrepository.com/).
- in my case i'll be using some dependencies that don't come with my IDE.
